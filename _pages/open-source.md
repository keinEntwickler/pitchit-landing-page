# Open Source

**Pitchit** is an ear-training game for iOS. Hear a tone, pick the matching note, and sharpen your musical ear one round at a time.

This app would not exist without open source. A lot of hard problems are already solved by people who share great tools and ideas, and this page is our thank-you note to them.

## This Landing Page

This landing page started as a fork of [Automatic App Landing Page](https://github.com/emilbaehr/automatic-app-landing-page) by [Emil Baehr](https://emilbaehr.com). We adapted it for Pitchit and added multilingual support.

## Thank You

Building an indie app as a solo developer is much easier because of the open-source community. If these libraries help your work too, please consider supporting their maintainers.
